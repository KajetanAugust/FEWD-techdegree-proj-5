This is my submission for Unit 3 project. It's a gallery page. It includes jQuery plugin for the lightbox (from fancybox http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) and the original jquery code for search function with keyup event listener.

jQuery search 
1. When key is pressed inside the input
2. The search input value is collected and transformed to lower case.
3. The data caption value is targetted
4. Each function loops through all data caption attribute values
5. Data caption attribute values are transformed to lower case and the <br> tag is removed
6. If function is checking if search value exist inside any of data caption attributes 
7. It hides this photos which are not matched.
